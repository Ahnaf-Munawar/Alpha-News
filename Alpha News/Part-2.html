    <h1> Harmful Effects of Misinformation </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Between truth and deception, misinformation has the ability to produce complex notions or overlap with other profound consequences. Some of these includes:</p>
    <p><span>1. Scepticism and uncertainty:</span> Misinformation thrives in an environment characterised by scepticism and uncertainty. Individuals become overly cautious and question the authenticity of information. In such an atmosphere, documentation can be a safeguard against disinformation. To counter this,  critical thinking, rigorous sourcing and citing, and accurate record-keeping are all essential tools to counter doubt and provide credible, trustworthy information.</p>
    <p><span>2. Division and polarisation:</span> Misinformation plays a significant role in fueling societal divisions and polarisation. As society becomes more divided, there is a risk that individuals may become selective in their acceptance of information based on their pre-existing beliefs. Documentation must strive to present an objective and unbiased view of facts to bridge these divides, promoting transparency and trust..</p>
    <p><span>3. Manipulation of emotions:</span> Misinformation often exploits negative emotions, such as fear, anger, and distrust, to manipulate individuals into believing false or misleading information. In turn, misinformation has an undeniable impact on free speech and dialogue by disrupting the chain of fair exchange.</p>
